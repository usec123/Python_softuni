parentElement.appendChild(childElement)
parentElement.removeChild(childElement)
childElement.remove()
replaceChild() (doesn't work in judge)

parent.append/prepend(child) => appends at the end/beginning of the parent (doesn't work in judge)
parent.insertBefore(child)
element.before/after(el) => inserts el before/after element in the same parent node

document.createElement - factory pattern for creating elements
document.createElement('p') => new <p>

to move element in DOM you insert it in the new location

element.cloneNode() => clones only the node of the element
element.cloneNode(true) => clones the element + all of its child nodes

how to add event listeners:
    element.addEventListener('name' (without 'on'), (event) => ...)
    element.event = (event) => ...
    func = (event) => ... / <. onclick='func()'>

.removeEventListener (requires function ref)

events can overlap - if multiple items share the event location
events are executed during bubbling phase - events from children are executed before events from parents

.addEventListener('eventType', function, options?)
options - { capture: true } (default false) - executes event during capturing phase of event propagation
event.stopPropagation();

event.preventDefault() => prevents default behaviour like form submission or a-tag page reloading
