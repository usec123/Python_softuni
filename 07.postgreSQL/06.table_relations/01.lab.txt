CASCADE OPERATIONS => changes to an entity apply to all related entities

CASCADE can be either UPDATE or DELETE

CASCADE DELETE is used when related entities are meaningless without the main (deleted) one
NOT USED when
	making logical deletion (deleting by setting a flag)
	preserving history
	circular references (doesn't work)

	CONSTRAINT fk_car_driver FOREIGN KEY(driver_id)
	REFERENCES drivers(driver_id) ON DELETE CASCADE


CASCADE UPDATE is used when PK is NOT auto-incremented and can be changed (best used with UNIQUE)
NOT USED when PK is auto-incremented

	CONSTRAINT fk_car_driver FOREIGN KEY(driver_id)
	REFERENCES drivers(driver_id) ON UPDATE CASCADE
