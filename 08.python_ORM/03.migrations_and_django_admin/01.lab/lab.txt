migrations

			add --empty for empty migration file
        migrate (app) (migration number / zero) => apply migrations to database (only for app [optional]) (rollback to specified migration [optional] / rollback all migrations)
        showmigrations (app) => shows all migrations (applied migrations have [X] in front of them)
        squashmigrations (n) => reduces migrations to less files (up to migration n)
        sqlmigrate (app) (migration) => returns SQL query for migration

    migrations file contents
        dependencies = [] # contains previous migrations that the current migration depends on

admin panel customizations
    by overriding str we can change the way objects are displayed (def __str__...)
    when using classes to register
        list_display = [] # arr of strings with fields to display
        list_filter = [] # arr of strings with fields to filter by
        search_fields = [] # ~ fields to search from
        fields = [('first_name', 'last_name'), 'email_address'] # groups first and last name fields when creating entry
		date_hierarchy = 'field' # allows filtering by given date field
		fieldsets => categorize and group fields
