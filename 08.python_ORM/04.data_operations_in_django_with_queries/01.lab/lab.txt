QuerySet
    translates Python code to SQL queries
    when Django executes a query on a model it returns either an object or a QuerySet
    lazy evaluation => queries are executed only once their result is required/accessed

Object Manager
    class attribute of a model with methods for querying the db
    default = objects
    methods:
        all()
        first()/last()
        get(**kwargs) => single obj that matches the given arg (multiple objects => Model.MultipleObjectsReturned error | no objects => Model.DoesNotExist error)
        create(**kwargs)
        filter(**kwargs)
        exclude(**kwargs) => opposite of filter()
        order_by(*fields) => orders previously returned querysets

Creating records in db
    ModelClass.objects.create(**kwargs)
        OR
    create instance of ModelClass, then instance.save()
