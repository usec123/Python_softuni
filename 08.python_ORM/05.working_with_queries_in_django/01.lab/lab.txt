methods
    filter(field_name=value) => returns QuerySet of matching entries
    exclude() => like filter, but returns everything that's NOT matching
    order_by(field_name: str, second_field) => last (after filter, exclude etc.) (for desc => '-field_name')
    count() => returns len of QuerySet without storing its values locally (length is calculated in the db)
    get(**kwargs) => returns SINGLE object matching the criteria (usually used with id because id is unique)

lookup keys
    used to specify conditions or filters
    to use => field_name__lookup_key=value
    can be chained

    __startswith
    __lt/lte/gt/gte
    __exact => default
    __iexact => case-insensitive
    __icontains
    __range => in range (inclusive)
    __year => gets year from datetime

bulk methods
    used to insert/update/delete objects simultaneously => optimization

    bulk_create(list)
    update/delete => chained with filter()
    bulk_update(list, ['fields'])
