--- Iterators ---
in order for a class to have an iterator, we must implement:
    - __iter__()
    - __next__()

this is called Iterator Protocol

you can iterate through some types ONLY ONCE (filter)

for uses this concept with a while loop to function:
    a = iter(range(n))
    while True:
        try:
            print(next(a))
        except StopIteration:
            break

for-loop handles StopIteration exception

--- Generators ---
generates items based on given parameters
uses yield to return results
    - yield works like return, but it saves the location of the line of code, and the next time the function is called it continues from there
