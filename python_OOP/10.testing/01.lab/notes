python library - unittest

tests are built to be more CONCRETE

triple A pattern:
    - Arrange - create input and expected output
    - Act - insert and execute input
    - Assert - compare output to expected output


Unit testing:
    - individual units/components of a software are tested
    - the purpose is to check if every unit of a software performs as expected

Test ficture - the place where tests are executed
Test case - checking if a unit works under specific conditions
Test suite - a collection of test cases
Test runner - sets up the execution of the tests and provides the outcome to the user
